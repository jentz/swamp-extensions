/**
 * Swamp workflow-scope report: `@jentz/aws-rds-reservation-coverage`.
 *
 * Consumes the `instance`, `reserved`, and `scan_error` resources produced
 * earlier in the workflow by `@jentz/aws-rds-reservations` and answers the
 * RDS reserved-instance planning question: **how many "large equivalents" of
 * size-flexible capacity must I still buy?** — the uncovered gap summed across
 * each reservation pool (region × family × engine). Pure data shaping — no AWS
 * API access.
 *
 * ## Normalization
 *
 * Each instance class is parsed into `family` (e.g. `r7g`), `generation`
 * (`7g`), and `size` (`2xlarge`). Size is converted to a **large-equivalent**
 * factor that doubles per size step, anchored at Single-AZ `large = 1`:
 *
 *   nano .0625 · micro .125 · small .25 · medium .5 · large 1 · xlarge 2 ·
 *   2xlarge 4 · 4xlarge 8 · 8xlarge 16 · 12xlarge 24 · 16xlarge 32 · 24xlarge 48
 *
 * (an `Nxlarge` is `2 × N`). A **Multi-AZ instance deployment then counts 2×**
 * the same-size Single-AZ deployment — this is AWS's normalized-unit table,
 * rescaled so a Single-AZ `large` is one unit. RI size-flexibility applies by
 * these units within a family and crosses the Multi-AZ/Single-AZ boundary, so
 * the units are commensurable: a Multi-AZ and a Single-AZ large-eq can be
 * summed. **Aurora is the exception** — see Bucketing.
 *
 * ## Bucketing
 *
 * Non-burstable, non-serverless capacity is summed into buckets keyed by
 * `region × family × engine × deployment(Multi-AZ|Single-AZ)` — the dimensions
 * an actual RDS reservation is scoped to, so each row maps to a purchasable
 * line item. For each bucket: `running_large_eq − reserved_large_eq = gap`. A
 * positive gap is under-covered capacity to buy; negative is over-coverage.
 *
 * **Aurora has no Multi-AZ DB instance reservation option** (the purchase
 * console pins the Single-AZ radio for Aurora; its availability comes from
 * cluster replicas, not a Multi-AZ instance deployment). So any Aurora engine
 * is forced to the `Single-AZ` deployment and never picks up the 2× weight —
 * an Aurora row never produces a Multi-AZ bucket, even if its upstream
 * `multiAZ` flag is set.
 *
 * Netting is **bucket-local**: a Single-AZ RI nets only Single-AZ running, a
 * Multi-AZ RI only Multi-AZ running. AWS in fact lets a Single-AZ RI spill
 * onto Multi-AZ usage (one family-wide normalized-unit pool); the per-bucket
 * gaps do not model that spill, so when a Single-AZ RI exceeds Single-AZ demand
 * one bucket can read over-reserved while another reads under — the **rollup
 * total is unaffected** (spill changes attribution, never the family total).
 *
 * A **reservation-pool rollup** groups buckets by region × family × engine,
 * collapsing only deployment (Single-AZ and Multi-AZ net together — Multi-AZ
 * folds in at 2×, so the units are commensurable). Engine is kept, because a
 * reservation cannot cover a different engine. The headline **large-equivalents
 * to buy** is the sum of the positive pool gaps: over-reserved pools never
 * offset under-reserved ones across the hard engine / family / region boundary.
 *
 * **Known limitation — Multi-AZ DB cluster (3-node):** the newer Multi-AZ DB
 * *cluster* deployment (1 primary + 2 readable standbys) consumes 3× normalized
 * units, but is not modeled here: upstream carries only a `multiAZ` boolean and
 * a `clusterId`, no reliable cluster-type signal. AWS reports each cluster
 * member through `DescribeDBInstances` (typically `MultiAZ=false`), so the
 * three members fall through as three individual Single-AZ instances —
 * approximately the 3× footprint by headcount, at 1× each.
 *
 * ## Carve-outs (never silently dropped)
 *
 *   - **Burstable** (`t`-class: t2/t3/t4g) capacity is reported separately as
 *     raw counts — burstable reservations are not size-flexible, so folding
 *     them into large-equivalents would mislead.
 *   - **Non-size-flex commercial** — **SQL Server** (all editions), **Oracle
 *     License-Included**, and **RDS Custom** (`custom-oracle-*`,
 *     `custom-sqlserver-*`). RDS size flexibility does not apply to these, so
 *     they are NOT folded into large-equivalents; they are reported as raw
 *     counts at `region × family × engine × size × deployment`, with edition
 *     and license preserved in the engine token.
 *   - **Serverless** (`db.serverless`, Aurora Serverless v2) is counted
 *     separately (ACU-billed, not instance-class capacity).
 *   - **Unparseable** classes are listed with a warning.
 *
 * A single shared {@link classify} routes every row for both the org-wide
 * {@link aggregate} and the per-account {@link aggregateByAccount}, so these
 * carve-outs surface per account too — the RI-discount-sharing-OFF purchase
 * list never silently drops an account whose footprint is entirely burstable,
 * serverless, or unparseable. The one exception is the non-size-flex commercial
 * carve-out, which has no per-account large-eq line and is surfaced org-wide.
 *
 * ## Engine, edition, and license
 *
 * The engine token preserves the dimensions an RDS reservation is actually
 * scoped to. Open-source and Aurora engines collapse to a base token (running
 * `postgres` and reserved `postgresql` both become `postgres`; Aurora variants
 * stay distinct). The **commercial** engines additionally carry edition and
 * license — `oracle-ee-byol`, `oracle-se2-li`, `sqlserver-se-li`,
 * `db2-ae-byol` — because a reservation matches on edition AND license: an
 * `oracle-se2` reservation does not cover an `oracle-ee` instance, and a
 * License-Included reservation does not cover a BYOL one. The running side's
 * license comes from the upstream `licenseModel` field; the reserved side's
 * from the product-description `(byol)`/`(li)` suffix. See
 * {@link parseEngineIdentity}.
 *
 * Size flexibility — and therefore large-equivalent netting — is applied only
 * to the engines AWS grants it to: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Db2, Aurora, and
 * Oracle **BYOL**. SQL Server, Oracle License-Included, and RDS Custom go to
 * the non-size-flex carve-out instead.
 *
 * ## Caveats
 *
 * Only `active` reservations count toward coverage. When the upstream
 * `licenseModel` is absent (rows swept before the field existed, or Aurora /
 * RDS Custom which do not report one), Oracle SE2 cannot be proven BYOL and is
 * routed conservatively to the non-size-flex carve-out rather than netted —
 * Oracle EE (BYOL-only) and standard RDS SQL Server (LI-only) are inferred from
 * the engine and remain unaffected. A re-sweep on the upstream model populates
 * the real license model.
 *
 * The report never throws — a missing upstream step, malformed artifact, or
 * schema drift degrades to a logged warning and a still-useful (possibly
 * empty) report.
